## Chess Project

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N
where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number of results is useful,
but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns
among the pieces.
